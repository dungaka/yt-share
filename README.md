# yt-share
I wanted to have a better thumbnails for my videos
but wasnt satisfied with current options.

### How it works ?
Basicaly it's about having the right meta tags
for facebook to embed the videos properly

With a mix of github pages and github api we can
bypass the need for a server an thus offert this simple
service for free.


This way it also is easier to customise and adapt to your needs.

### alternatives:
[yt2fb.com](http://yt2fb.com/)
*completly bloated with ads, require login*

[fbvidthis.com](http://fbvidthis.com/)
*way better than yt2fb still has some ads*
